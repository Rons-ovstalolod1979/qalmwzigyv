Heyy, just finished watching Riff Raff, and omg, what a trip. I’m sitting here like, what did I just watch? 😅 You know when a movie just leaves you kinda speechless but like in a good way? That’s me right now. The whole thing with Stevie and the construction sites and all. Legit felt like I was right there in those grimy places. 

But seriously, some parts were just a mess, like in a chaotic, lovable way? You ever feel that way about a movie? And the music, ugh, so raw and jangly, loved it! Gary Oldman really out there making life depressing af but, like, can’t stop watching him. I mean, try downloading the movie and you’ll get it. It’s got this gritty, real feel, ya know?

> Okay, okay, hear me out: there was this one scene that just cracked me up even though it was probably supposed to be serious? I couldn’t help thinking, yeah, that's how things go sometimes. 😂 Just all the randomness and how messy everything can get. Like, life's not polished, and that film just smacked you in the face with it.

And what's up with some of those accents, tho? Could barely catch half of it, but you roll with it, right? Haha, might need to watch the movie again just to catch all the stuff I missed with the volume turned all the way up this time. It's like, written in the stars or something, that these films have such a weird pull.

Anyway, I’m gonna stop rambling, but really, that flick had me feeling all sorts of ways! I’m tired, but like, mentally charged too? Lemme know if you wanna catch up on it sometime, or maybe something lighter? God, I dunno, my brain's fried. 🤷‍♀️

You ever get hit by a movie that makes you wanna just lie down and think about life? Yeah, that’s me right now. 😂 Lmk what you're watching, or just share memes or whatever. I'm down!
